To compile the program you need the following:

A working "C" compiler installation, along with libc and libm libraries.
A working "make" utility.
Optionally the SDL2 library with X11 to enable -view switch.

Make files are provided for GNUGCC/Cygwin inside the source dir.
To compile the program, issue the command:

make -f makefile.linux-gnu

this will compile an SDL2 enabled version of the software, to compile
without SDL2 use:

make -f makefile.linux-gnu nosdl

Under windows use

make -f makefile.win

you will end with an executable name segy-change in the same directory 
of the source files.

To test the program an EXAMPLES folder containing data and example scripts 
are given.
